Description: For researchers to quickly and comprehensively acquire disease genes, so as to understand the mechanism of disease,
  we developed this program to acquire disease-related genes.
  The data is integrated from three public databases. The three databases are 'eDGAR', 'DrugBank'
  and 'MalaCards'. The 'eDGAR' is a comprehensive database, containing data on the relationship between disease and genes.
  'DrugBank' contains information on 13443 drugs and 5157 targets. 'MalaCards' integrates human disease information, including disease-related genes.
